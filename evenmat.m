% EVENMAT :-)   some general information about these routines
%
% EVENMAT (Even's assorted matlab-functions)
%
% Most of these files are my own specialized M-files, functions that I made
% when I felt it needed. Some are quite neat, some might be obsolete, others
% even incomplete... In short, this is just my local matlab directory with
% all it's contents. However you might need some of it if you want to run
% other functions of mine.
%
% CHANGES are made every now and then, quite often actually, but the m-files
% all have their Time-stamp. 
%
% CROSSREFERENCES are used a lot, so a download of it all is
% recommended. Downloading just one function might send you back here
% searching for it's required functions. The lot can be found in the
% evenmat.zip file.
%
% Local users at the GFI might be best helped just adding the path with
% addpath('/home2/even/matlab/evenmat')
%
% Local users at NERSC might be best helped just adding the path with
% addpath('/home/even/matlab/evenmat')
%
% Good luck!

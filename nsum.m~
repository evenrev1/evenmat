function y = nsum(x,dim)
% NSUM  Sum ignoring NaNs (w/choice of dimension)
%
%   NSUM(X) returns the sum treating NaNs as missing values.  
%   For vectors, NSUM(X) is the sum of the non-NaN elements in
%   X. For matrices, NSUM(X) is a row vector containing the sum 
%   of the non-NaN elements in each column of X. 
%  
%   NSUM(X,DIM) sums along the dimension DIM. 
% 
%   See also NANMEDIAN, NANSTD, NMEAN.

% Yes, this is a dirty hack of statistics toolbox' NANSUM, but hey,
% that code anyone could have made, and they did forget to port
% the dimension option of SUM.

function [dx,dt,I,J,JJ] = nearpos(LONG,LAT,T,long,lat,t,mdx,mdt,p)
% NEARPOS	Nearest geographical-temporal neighbours
% 
% [dx,dt,I,J,JJ] = nearpos(LONG,LAT,T,long,lat,t,mdx,mdt,p)
% 
% LONG,LAT = Scalar or vector with the main set of positions.
% T        = Matlab serial day times for the main set of positions.
% long,lat = vectors with the other set of positions.
% t        = Matlab serial day times the other set of positions.
% mdx,mdt  = max limits for distance (km) and time (Â±days), by which
%            to select other positions that are 'near' enough.
% p        = fraction defining priority between distance and days
%            when sorting the selected positions by 'nearness'. The
%            combined space-time 'distance' is calculated as 
%			sqrt( p*dx.^2 + (1-p)*dt.^2 ). 
%	     I.e. with 0 distance does not matter at all, while with
%	     1 time does not matter at all. (default = 0.5 = 50/50
%	     between km/days.)  
%
% dx       = MxN matrix of distances between the M main positions and
%            the N other positions.
% dt       = matrix of time differences in the same format as dx.
% I        = subscripts to the rows of dx and dt for differences
%            inside the limits set by mdx and mdt, i.e. which main
%            positions has 'near neighbours' in the other positions.
% J        = subscripts to the columns of dx and dt for differences
%            inside the limits set by mdx and mdt, i.e. which of the
%            other positions are the 'near neigbours'.
% JJ       = Mx1 cell with groups of indices to other positions
%            nearby, for each main position. Will be empty when no
%            near neighbours are found. 
%
% The subscripts are sorted by 'nearness' to each main position.
% JJ=J(ismember(I,27)) returns indices for the other positions near
% enough to the 27th main position, sorted with the nearest first. So
% for [LONG(27),LAT(27),T(27)], the nearest neighbours are
% [long(JJ,lat(JJ),t(JJ)]. For your convenience this is utilised in the
% making of output JJ, so that each cell in JJ contains the neighbours
% of each main position, so that the distance to the nearest neighbour
% of main profile 27 is dx(27,JJ{27}(1)), and likewise for dt. 
%
% A 3D plot of all points and connections is made if no output is
% requested.
%
% This function requires the SEAWATER toolbox.
